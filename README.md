## Visualising and analysing US Trans Survey Data

Learning plotly.py by visualising some percentage data taken from the [2015 and 2022 US Transgender Surveys](https://ustranssurvey.org/).

### Here are the results

The sample group was significantly larger (more than tripling from 27,715 in 2015 to 92,329 in 2022) in the 2022 survey, yet the percentages largely remained similar.

Trans women are still more common than trans men, in spite of lower overall amab numbers, while afab nonbinaries still vastly outnumber amab ones. Crossdressers remain in the vast minority as well.

Trans women's lead over trans men's numbers has increased noticeably.

Overall, we still have an afab majority among the general trans population, although this has slightly improved (likely due to the increase in trans women's/decrease in trans men's percentages).

Supposing that an equal amount of either birthsex *is* (medically speaking) transgender, and in the knowledge that detransitioners who detransition due to legitimately not being trans after all are a dismissibly small minority,

> 2015 USTS Chapter 7 Section C on detransition outlines that only 8% of respondants reported ever having detransitionned, of which only 5% (that is 0.4% of total respondants) reported that their reason for detransition was that "They realized that gender transition was not for them" (while 62% (about 5 out of those 8%) reported that they were currently living in a gender role other than their birth-assigned one).

it seems unlikely that it would be cis women mistakenly labelling themselves as transmascs causing this discrepency. 

Therefore we can instead suppose that amab trans people still feel less able to come out as trans and seek the transition (social and medical) they need than afab ones.

### Nonbinary numbers

Among the nonbinary participants, afab nonbinaries remain in the vast majority, making up roughly 4/5 of the community.

Around the time of the first survey, the reigning theory in the community (source: me, who came out as NB in 2014) for why there were less amab nonbinaries than afab ones was that it was due to lack of nonbinary awareness among amab people. That -given time and awareness raising for nonbinary as a concept in wider society- that number would balance out eventually and we would have a roughly equal amount of amab and afab NBs, the same as trans men and women were roughly balanced.

TURNS OUT THIS WAS INCORRECT. 

Despite an increase in the community's numbers at large due to more awareness and the pandemic forcing people to sit with themselves (= current reigning theories in the community) (source: me, who (as just one example) attended Trans Pride Brighton in 2019 and 2022 and can attest to a *significant* increase in attendance between the two events.) as well as in the sample size of the 2022 survey, the percentage of amab nonbinaries has remained almost stagnant in these 7 years of trans and nb awareness raising.

What change there has been has been a slight increase to all identities other than trans men and crossdressers, who lost percentages, trans men's percentage being hit the hardest with a 4 percent point drop.

I believe this is a sign that:
- The reason there are less amab nonbinaries is NOT about awareness, it is about *gender roles*.

    The only difference between transmascs and transfemmes is their direction. The gender roles they come from and that they go towards. 

    Supposing that whatever the intrinsic motivations for using a nonbinary label may be are similarly balanced experiences as those of binary trans people (where it is largely medical gender dysphoria), the only thing that such a stark difference in claiming the label could be attributed to is the external, social aspect that is gender roles.

    Amab and afab people face different pressures based on their gender roles, and that reflects in their likelihood of claiming the nonbinary label:

    - Afab people face less pressure to stay women, leading to more trans-identified afab people than trans-identified amab people overall. If it doesn't work for them they can easily claim the nonbinary label, because the female gender role doesn't consider you a defector unless you Are A Man. It retains control and influence because it doesn't fully cut people off until they reach patriarchy's gates.

    - These transmascs internalise the deep-seated misandry and manhate the female gender role and feminism promote, putting them under pressure not to be men (cause men are bad obviously ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), leading to more hesitation around claiming manhood, even when they are literally medically pursuing masculinising transition. This leads to the inflated nonbinary rate we're seeing among transmascs.

    - Amab people face more pressure to stay men. Unless it really isn't working for you, you are to stick to the male gender role. Patriarchy, unlike matriarchy, worries greatly about defectors and will do whatever it takes to try and prevent escape. This leads to less amab people claiming trans identities overall despite more trans awareness.

    - Transfemmes, successfully having escaped, are cut off by the male gender role, leaving little merit in the nonbinary label for them. Additionally womanhood is significantly less stigmatised and more desirable than manhood (gets ya empathy, aesthetics, desirability, and, thanks to feminism, also means ya get to keep all the stuff the male gender role has like jobs, bank accounts, pants, etc). This leads to the higher rate of trans women we see despite the overall amab minority, and the incredibly low amab nonbinary rate.

- Nonbinary awareness isn't helping free gender roles. 

    It offers reprieve from them for people who struggle to fit in for various reasons, but because genderqueer people label themselves as nonbinary, withdrawing their membership from either gender role, rather than claiming it, their gender transgressions do not impact binary gender roles as much as they would if they were committing them under those labels. 

    - Ex. An amab or physically masculine looking person wearing a skirt is highly transgressive if they identify as a man, but expected and highly irrelevant to the male gender role if they identify as nonbinary, leaving the male status quo intact. If this is a medically transmasculine person or an amab person who does not plan on physically transitionning, that likely means they could reasonably claim the male label if they wanted to, yet they don't.

### Conclusion

I believe that a lot of trans men/strongly trans-male-aligned people are currently still labelling themselves as nonbinary due to internalised misandrist stigma preventing them from claiming the male label (source: me, who was doing that for a decade, and finally realised my mistake), and that we are still missing a lot more amab trans people who have yet to come out due to pressure from gender roles.
    
As gender lib progress happens, I hope to see these numbers balance out, including nonbinary afab numbers finally decreasing, instead joining the trans male block, and amab overall numbers continuing to increase.
